The Health Monitor is for all teams â€“ period. Whether your team is high-performing, or deeply dysfunctional; no matter your level, function, or industry. 

Part cure, part preventative medicine, the Health Monitor is your team's chance to listen to each other and take an honest look in the mirror. You'll assess against eight attributes common among healthy teams, and walk away with a better understanding of your strengths (plus plans to address your weak spots).

Anybody can run a Health Monitor workshop, so don't wait around for some directive from on high. YOU are the change you've been waiting for.
